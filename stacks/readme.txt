--------STACK------------

What is a Stack?

- A LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure
- The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack.

- We have seen this before - Callstack
- Where stacks are used: 
    1. Managing function invocation
    2. Undo and redo
    3. Routing (the history object is treated like a stack)

- There are more than one way of implementing stack.
    - Array implmentation using push() and pop() method
    - Linked list implmentation

- Big O of stacks
    - Insertion - O(1)
    - Removal - O(1)
    - Search - O(n)
    - Access - O(n)
